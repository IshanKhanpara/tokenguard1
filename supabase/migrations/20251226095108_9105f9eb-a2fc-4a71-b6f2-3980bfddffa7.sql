-- Fix: Block anonymous access to profiles table
-- Currently, unauthenticated users can query all profile data

-- Drop existing overly permissive policies and recreate with auth requirement
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all profiles" ON public.profiles;

-- Create policies that require authentication
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" 
ON public.profiles 
FOR SELECT 
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile" 
ON public.profiles 
FOR UPDATE 
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all profiles" 
ON public.profiles 
FOR SELECT 
TO authenticated
USING (public.has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'));
